@article{ilievski2020role,
	abstract = {Identifying entities in text is an important step of semantic analysis. Some entity mentions comprise a name or description, but many include no information that identifies them in the system's knowledge resources, which means that their identity cannot be established through traditional disambiguation. Consequently, such NIL (not in lexicon) entities have received little attention in entity linking systems and tasks so far. However, given the non-redundancy of knowledge on NIL entities, their lack of frequency priors, their potentially extreme ambiguity, and their numerousness, they constitute an important class of long-tail entities and pose a great challenge for state-of-the-art systems. In this paper, we describe a method for imputing identifying knowledge to NILs from generalized characteristics. We enrich the locally extracted information with profile models that rely on background knowledge in Wikidata. We describe and implement two profiling machines using state-of-the-art neural models. We evaluate their intrinsic behavior and their impact on the task of determining the identity of NIL entities.},

We provide our first results of data acquisition, together with the first data release. We introduce the notion of cross-lingual referential corpora. These corpora consist of texts that make reference to exactly the same incidents. The referential grounding allows us to analyze the framing of these incidents in different languages and across different texts. During the project, we will use the automatically generated data to study linguistic framing as a phenomenon, build framing resources such as lexicons and corpora. We expect to capture larger variation in framing compared to traditional approaches for building such resources. Our first data release, which contains structured data about a large number of incidents and reference texts, can be found at http://dutchframenet.nl/data-releases/.},

Explanations have been shown to increase the understanding and trust of a user in human- agent interaction. There have been numerous studies investigating this effect, but they rely on the user explicitly requesting an explanation. We propose a first overview of when an explanation should be triggered and show that there are many instances that would be missed if the agent solely relies on direct questions. For this, we differentiate between direct triggers such as commands or questions and intro- duce indirect triggers like confusion or uncertainty detection.},

In this paper, we investigate such sequential cross-modal alignment by modelling the image description generation process computationally. We take as our starting point a state-of-the-art image captioning system and develop several model variants that exploit information from human gaze patterns recorded during language production. In particular, we propose the first approach to image description generation where visual processing is modelled sequentially. Our experiments and analyses confirm that better descriptions can be obtained by exploiting gaze-driven attention and shed light on human cognitive processes by comparing different ways of aligning the gaze modality with language production. We find that processing gaze data sequentially leads to descriptions that are better aligned to those produced by speakers, more diverse, and more natural---particularly when gaze is encoded with a dedicated recurrent component.},

	abstract = {Multilingual representations have mostly been evaluated based on their performance on specific tasks. In this article, we look beyond engineering goals and analyze the relations between languages in computational representations. We introduce a methodology for comparing languages based on their organization of semantic concepts. We propose to conduct an adapted version of representational similarity analysis of a selected set of concepts in computational multilingual representations. Using this analysis method, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree that closely resembles those assumed by linguistic experts. These results indicate that multilingual distri-butional representations that are only trained on monolingual text and bilingual dictionaries preserve relations between languages without the need for any etymological information. In addition, we propose a measure to identify semantic drift between language families. We perform experiments on word-based and sentence-based multilingual models and provide both quantitative results and qualitative examples. Analyses of semantic drift in multilingual representations can serve two purposes: They can indicate unwanted characteristics of the computational models and they provide a quantitative means to study linguistic phenomena across languages.},

	abstract = {NLP models are imperfect and lack intricate capabilities that humans access automatically when processing speech or reading a text. Human language processing data can be leveraged to increase the performance of models and to pursue explanatory research for a better understanding of the differences between human and machine language processing. We review recent studies leveraging different types of cognitive processing signals, namely eye-tracking, M/EEG and fMRI data recorded during language understanding. We discuss the role of cognitive data for machine learning-based NLP methods and identify fundamental challenges for processing pipelines. Finally, we propose practical strategies for using these types of cognitive signals to enhance NLP models.},

We compare these descriptions to solve a cross-document event coreference task. Our com- ponent approach to event semantics defines identity and granularity of events at different levels. It performs close to state-of-the-art approaches on the cross-document event coreference task, while outperforming other works when assuming similar quality of event detection. We demonstrate how granularity and identity are interconnected and we discuss how se- mantic anomaly could be used to define differences between coreference, subevent and topical relations.},

We present a robot that models relativity of knowledge and perception within social interaction following principles of the theory of mind. We utilized vision and speech capabilities on a Pepper robot to build an interaction model that stores the interpretations of perceptions and conversations in combination with provenance on its sources. The robot learns directly from what people tell it, possibly in relation to its perception. We demonstrate how the robot's communication is driven by hunger to acquire more knowledge from and on people and objects, to resolve uncertainties and conflicts, and to share awareness of the perceived environment. Likewise, the robot can make reference to the world and its knowledge about the world and the encounters with people that yielded this knowledge.},

We report on the current methods to create event reference data by annotating texts and deriving the event data a posteriori. Our method starts from event registries in which event data is defined a priori. From this data, we extract so-called Microworlds of referential data with the Reference Texts that report on these events. This makes it possible to easily establish referential relations with high precision and at a large scale. In a pilot, we successfully obtained data from these resources with extreme ambiguity and variation, while maintaining the identity and reference relations and without having to annotate large quantities of texts word-by-word. The data from this pilot was annotated using an annotation tool created specifically in order to validate our method and to enrich the reference texts with event coreference annotations. This annotation process resulted in the Gun Violence Corpus, whose development process and outcome are described in this paper.},

Co-referring words, however, tend to occur in the same topical context but in different local contexts. In addition, they may express different concepts related through topical coherence, and through author framing and perspective. In this paper, we describe how reference relations can be added to WordNet and how they can be acquired. We evaluate two methods of extracting event coreference relations using WordNet relations against a manual annotation of 38 documents within the same topical domain of gun violence. We conclude that precision is reasonable but recall is lower because the WordNet hierarchy does not sufficiently capture the required coherence and perspective relations.},

The results confirm our hypothesis that taxonomy-based approaches are more suitable to identify similarity. We introduce two new measures of evaluation that show that all measures perform well on a coarse-grained evaluation and that it is not always clear which approach is most suitable when a similarity score is used as a threshold. This leads us to conclude that the inferior performance of corpus-based approaches may not (always) matter.},
